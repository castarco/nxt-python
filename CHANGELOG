* Created this changelog
* Changed set_input_mode behaviour to take parameters. TODO: Make it remember last mode for analog sensors
* Made get_input_values() return RawReading, and added get_reading() returning named values.
* Changed the way digital sensors work, partially getting rid of metaclasses and breaking everything in the process (no access to hardware)
