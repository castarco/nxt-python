NXT-Python is a package for controlling a LEGO NXT robot using the Python
programming language. It can communicate using either USB or Bluetooth. It is
available under the Free Software Foundation's GPL license. It is based on
NXT_Python, where releases halted in May 2007.

This version is part of the 2.x series of releases. Programs designed for
NXT_Python or for the 1.x series will not work with this version. If you are
trying to get an old program to work, it most likely needs a 1.x series release,
which can be downloaded from the nxt-python googlecode downloads page.

Once your installation is working, I would really appreciate it if you could run
the nxt_sensor_report script and follow the instructions there to help improve
the digital sensor type checking system. It takes maybe 5-10 minutes and is a
way to really help out even if you have no technical skill or don't want to mess
with the code. Thanks!

Note: NXT-Python has not been tested and may not work with custom nxt firmware
versions (if you don't know what that means, you don't need to worry about it).
However, if the custom firmware uses the standard communcations protocol,
everything should more or less work. NXT-Python was primarily developed with
bricks using firmware version 1.5 and is compatible with bricks using protocol
version 1.124.

Requirements:

	* Python 2.6 (http://www.python.org)
	* PyBluez (Bluetooth library) (http://org.csail.mit.edu/pybluez/)
		and / or
	* PyUSB (USB library) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/)

Installation:

	* Untar/unzip source package
	* In package directory, run "python setup.py install" (as root), or if
		under windows, double-click install.bat.
	* For USB on Linux, at a root terminal type:
		groupadd lego
		usermod -a -G lego [username]
		echo 'BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"' > \
			/etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules
