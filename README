NXT-Python is a package for controlling a LEGO NXT robot using the Python
programming language. It can communicate using either USB or Bluetooth. It is
available under the Gnu GPL license. It is based on NXT_Python, where releases
halted in May 2007.

This version is part of the 2.x series of releases. Programs designed for
NXT_Python or for the 1.x series of nxt-python will not work with this version.
If you are trying to get an old program to work, it most likely needs a 1.x
series release, which can be downloaded from the nxt-python downloads page at
googlecode.

Requirements:

    * Python 2.6 (http://www.python.org)
    And at least one comm library:
    * Bluetooth communications:
        Linux/Windows: PyBluez  (http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/)
            (package python-bluez in deb-based linuxes)
        Mac: LightBlue (http://lightblue.sourceforge.net/)
    * USB communications:
        PyUSB (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/)

Installation:

    * Untar/unzip source package
    * In package directory, run "python setup.py install" (as root), or if
        under windows, double-click install.bat.
    * To use USB on Linux as non-supeuser, at a root terminal type:
        groupadd lego
        usermod -a -G lego [username]
        echo 'BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"' > \
            /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules

The arduino directory of an svn checkout (not included with release packages)
contains a digital sensor unit test system called nxtduemu. It is intended for
developers and advanced users who are looking to experiment with sensors and
the digital sensor framework and classes. See arduino/README for more info.

Note: NXT-Python has not been tested and may not work with custom nxt firmware
versions (if you don't know what that means, you don't need to worry about it).
However, if the firmware uses the standard USB/BT communcations protocol,
everything should more or less work. NXT-Python has been tested with bricks
using firmware version up to 1.29 and is compatible with protocol version 1.124.
