NXT_Python/NXT-Python

NXT_Python is a package for controlling a LEGO NXT robot using the Python
programming language. It can communicate using either USB or Bluetooth. It is
available under the Free Software Foundation's GPL license. It was developed on
Fedora Core (Linux), but has been tested on Windows as well.
Releases halted in May 2007.

NXT-Python is based on NXT_Python, but is significantly newer, and, as time
goes on, different/better. This is NXT-Python.

Note: NXT-Python has not been tested and may not work with
custom nxt firmware versions (if you don't know what that means, you don't
need to worry about it).

Requirements:

	* Python 2.6 (http://www.python.org)
	* PyBluez (Bluetooth library) (http://org.csail.mit.edu/pybluez/)
		and / or
	* PyUSB (USB library) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/)

Installation:

	* Untar/unzip source package
	* In package directory, run "python setup.py install" (as root), or if
		under windows, copy the nxt folder to the site-packages
		directory in your python installation.
	* For USB on Linux, at a root terminal type:
		groupadd lego
		usermod -a -G lego [username]
		echo 'BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"' > \
			/etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules
